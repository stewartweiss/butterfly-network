## About This Repository

This repository contains a small program that computes the "cross edges"
in a butterfly network.

Compiling instructions are in the code. The program expects an integer
argument that specifies the order of the network, which is one less than
the number of rows, or equivalently, the log base 2 of the number of
columns.
